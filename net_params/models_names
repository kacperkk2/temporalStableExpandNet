Training consists of two phases: base and fine tuning. Model name indicates tactic used during training phase. 
"base" indicates first phase of training, "tuning" second phase.
"Rec" means that net was trained only in terms of reconstruction, "Stab" means that net was trained in terms of reconstruction and stability.
Loss at the end of model name indicates loss function used as stability term. 

- baseRec_tuningRec: base model, trained only in terms of reconstruction
- baseRec_tuningStab_L1Loss: fine tuning with stability term (L1 loss used) 
- baseRec_tuningStab_L2Loss: fine tuning with stability term (L2 loss used)
- baseRec_tuningStab_recLoss: fine tuning with stability term (expandNet loss used)
- baseRec_tuningStab_ssimLoss: fine tuning with stability term (ssim used)
